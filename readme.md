A client-side js proxy that loads static website content from the GitHub API. Currently uses Basic Auth, so I'd recommend only signing in with an account that has restricted permissions (for instance set up an account that can only pull, and only grant that account to the repositories you want to use with this).

## Use

- load a private branch with static website content (the _site/* content for Jekyll sites).
- go to http://dhcole.github.com/gh-proxy/ and fill out the form


## Disclaimer

This is experimental. Not sure if you'd really want to use this as is.
